npm primer

so how do you prepare code for the registry?
.json file

npm install
puts all your dependencies in "node_modules" folder
makes your repos smaller
less copying of "stuff"
your dependencies stay where they're supposed to

.json file acts like a "recipe"
npm install
= please download any stuff that this project need from the given repos

There are even "private registries"
larger projects
more secure environments
need -everything- to be behind a secure firewall
even copies of open source libraries you use



So how do you start using npm?
Install the app from nodejs.org
Done.

So how do you start using CommandBox?
Same answer.
